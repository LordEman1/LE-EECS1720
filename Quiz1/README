What I did, How I did it, and How to Use it:

In the index.html file i added an image and changed it asthetically in the style.css file.
I made the sketch.js canvas fit the whole window by adding windowWidth and windowHeight to the create canvas peramiters.
You can run it by just opening the index.html file on your browser and moving the mouse on the canvas bellow the angry image.
